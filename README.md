# react-spa

Starter kit for a React single-page app.

# TODO

* test static build on non-root url with react-routed fragments
* make three routes for /, /about, and a default "lost" 404 page
* make some nav links
* make some base styles
* use generic loading graphic
* dynamically inject some variables into the html container


## Setup

* clone repo
* `npm install`
* `npm start`


## How It Works

When started, it compiles the browser-side JSX, SASS, static assets, and HTML container.
It runs browser-sync and watches files to live-reload changes.

* react router dom
* browser-sync
* sass
* webpack within gulp
